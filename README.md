U3D tools
=========

This project is based on libU3D: libU3D is a Universal 3D parsing library focused on readability and simplicity.
Thanks to Hiroka Ihara for starting this (https://github.com/ihr486/libU3D.git).
The goal is to get familiar with the U3D format and to come up with diagnostics tools helping to check U3D files well-formedness.
